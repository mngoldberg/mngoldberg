# 👋 Hi, I’m Maddie!

I'm a PhD student in Psychology at the University of Oregon, where I study how brain development, puberty, and hormones shape social motivation and reward processing during adolescence.

My work bridges developmental neuroscience and biobehavioral science, with a focus on advanced (often non-linear!) statistical modeling of longitudinal data.

## 🔬 What I use GitHub for:
- Reproducible research & analysis pipelines  
- Sharing code and tools for modeling complex developmental data  
- Learning & contributing to open science  
- (Eventually!) communicating science more accessibly  

## 🧠 Research Interests
- Longitudinal neurodevelopment
- Pubertal maturation & hormone-behavior links
- Social reward and motivation
- Statistical modeling & data visualization

## ✨ A little extra
Outside the lab, I’m usually out running, biking, or swimming (no triathlons… yet). I speak English, some Spanish, and a bit of French.
